Cultural Note:
This project is developed with deep respect for Guadeloupean Creole culture 
and language. The Potomitan™ brand and associated cultural elements are used 
with permission and cultural sensitivity.

Kreyòl Guadeloupéen is a vibrant living language that deserves technological 
support and preservation. This keyboard aims to facilitate digital communication 
in Creole while honoring its rich cultural heritage.
